# Shotgun 

**We're building spec-driven development for AI coding agents.**

AI agents made developers fast at building. Also made them fast at building the wrong things.

Cursor, Claude Code, Copilot - they generate code immediately without asking: does this already exist in your codebase?

Result: duplicated code. Conflicting architecture. Technical debt at AI speed.

## What Shotgun Does

**Research → Specify → Plan → Tasks → Export**

Shotgun indexes your entire codebase, researches internal patterns + external solutions, writes specs with full context. Your AI agent gets complete context - what exists, why, and what to build.

Real case: We needed payments. AI agents suggested building a custom proxy (3-4 weeks). Shotgun found LiteLLM Proxy in 30 minutes. Implementation: 5 days. First customer: 14 hours later. 80% less dev time.
